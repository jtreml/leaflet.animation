Leaflet animation framework
===========================

A lightweight, care-free animation framework for the awesome [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) maps engine.

This framework has no intention of providing the most complete and customizable animation solution for leaflet. It is meant to be as easy to use as possible; add a time coordinate to your geometry and let the animation framework do the rest. If you need lots of control and special effects, have a look at Leaflet [RaphaelLayer](http://dynmeth.github.io/RaphaelLayer/) or be on the lookout for updates to the [Leaflet plugin directory](http://leafletjs.com/plugins.html).
